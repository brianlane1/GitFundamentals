# git config 

When first setting up git, you'll need to work with the git config commands in order to set up your identity.

For example, your identity can be set up with commands such as:

```
git config --global user.name "brianlane1"
git config --global user.email brianlane1@outlook.com
```

For more information, view the [first time git setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) documentation.
